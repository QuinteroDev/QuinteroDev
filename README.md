## üöÄ About Me:

I‚Äôm Quintero, a passionate technologist with a knack for solving complex problems through code and data. My journey in tech is fueled by a relentless curiosity and a drive to continually learn and evolve.

Currently, I‚Äôm channeling my entrepreneurial spirit as an Amazon Seller, where I focus on the pet products niche. This venture has honed my skills in e-commerce, product management, and customer-centric strategies.

On the technical side, I‚Äôm a skilled software developer with a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies. My experience spans various programming languages and frameworks, enabling me to build robust, scalable applications tailored to specific business needs.

In addition to my development expertise, I have a strong background in data analysis. I recently earned certification in Microsoft Power BI, which has expanded my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights. Whether it‚Äôs through data visualization or predictive modeling, I thrive on making data-driven decisions that drive growth and innovation.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm an avid explorer‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs hiking new trails or diving into the rich histories and cultures of different regions. I believe in the power of continuous learning and personal growth, and I apply this philosophy both in my professional and personal life.

Let‚Äôs connect and create something amazing together!
